I have adopted the MARKOWITZ Portfolio Theory which when proposed revolutionized portfolio management by introducing the concept of diversification and trade-off between risk and return.
The model suggests that an investor can construct an efficient portfolio by carefully selecting a combination of assets that maximizes returns for a given level of risk or minimizes risk for a desired level of returns using SHARPE RATIO.
